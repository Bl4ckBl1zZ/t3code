Use this to monitor or babysit a pull request instead of polling, sleeping, or running a watcher. Only comments posted after this call wake you, so handle the existing ones first, then end your turn. A wake is news, not a merge decision: check readiness yourself before merging. While T3 Code watches, the thread stays in the user's Working list, not their inbox. When you hand the work back to the user, call unwatch_pull_request first so the thread returns to their inbox. Watching ends when the pull request merges or closes, when its thread settles or is archived, when T3 Code fails to read it 8 times in a row (a host rate limit only delays it), when the user stops this thread, or when you call unwatch_pull_request. Unsettle the thread before starting a new watch. A subagent cannot watch: its parent thread owns the pull request.",
